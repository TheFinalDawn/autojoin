# Autojoin
Welcome to the github repo for Autojoin. This is where the dev will upload the source code of the mod, and where you can politely inform her that her mod broke again in the [issues tab](https://github.com/TheFinalDawn/autojoin/issues). You probably already read the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autojoin), so I doubt I need to rewrite the about page.
# How to Use
The initial setup is pretty simple considering it doesn't have a GUI:
## With Configured (or any other mod that lets you edit config files in-game):
1. Click Mods, scroll to Autojoin, and click Config
2. Click Targeting, then click Edit next to Target Server Address
3. Type in your server address
4. Open Target Server Name and add whatever you want
5. Save the config
## Without Configured
1. Go to your pack install directory (in Curseforge, you can click the 3 dots next to play after clicking on a modpack to quickly find it), open up the config folder
2. Doubleclick "autojoin-common.toml"
3. Edit the values in the Targeting block to your liking
4. Ctrl+S
# Downloads and Installation
This mod is found **only** on the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autojoin).
